  - 28 Property cards (all color sets)
  - 11 Wild Property cards
  - 34 Action cards
  - 17 Rent cards
- [x] **chaos-events.json**: 10 initial chaos events with balanced effects
- [x] **shared/types.ts**: TypeScript type definitions for game objects

### Frontend Setup (React + Vite + TypeScript)

- [x] React 18 with TypeScript configuration
- [x] Vite for fast development and building
- [x] Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- [x] Zustand for state management (installed)
- [x] Socket.IO Client for real-time communication
- [x] Basic UI wireframes implemented (Menu → Lobby → Game)
- [x] Game-themed styling with card classes and animations

- [x] CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- [x] Environment configuration (`.env.example`)
- [x] Basic endpoints (`/`, `/health`)
- [x] Socket event handlers for game rooms
- [x] TypeScript compilation and build process

### Testing & Validation

- [x] Frontend builds successfully
- [x] Backend compiles without errors
- [x] Development servers start correctly
- [x] Basic socket communication structure in place
